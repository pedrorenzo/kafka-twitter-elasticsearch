# About this project
In this project, we have a producer who reads Twitter messages containing certain text and a consumer, who consumes those messages and puts them on ElasticSearch.
We also have another way to connect and produce Twitter messages through Kafka Connect. In addition, we also use Kafka Stream to filter Twitter data.
These examples were made following this great [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka/).
